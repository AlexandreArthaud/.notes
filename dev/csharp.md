# C#

## Dotnet

After you've install .NET, the **dotnet.exe** tool will be available in Command Line. You can use
it to generate or various C# projects. You can use it to check current .NET version
(`dotnet --version`), whether you could update .NET (`dotnet sdk check`), and more.

You can use *dotnet* to generate and run a project for you. For example, run
**dotnet new TEMPLATE** to generate a project. The various possible templates
are: *console* (Console Application), *classlib* (Class Library), *wpf* (WPF Application), etc. 
(there are many others).

Once you've generated the structure for your poject, you can run **dotnet build** and
**dotnet run** to compile and run your project.
