## World Languagees

Theese living languages are the most spoken and influential on a global basis. Of course,
only **English** has a truly global scale, but some languages on this list, especially the higher
ranked ones, have massive amounts of speaker and geographical reach.

|    | Language        | Speakers (%) |
| -- | --------------- | -----------  |
| 01 | **English**     | ~1.5B        |
| 02 | **Chinese**     | ~1.5B        |
| 03 | **Hindustani**  | ~800M        |
| 04 | **Spanish**     | ~500M        |
| 05 | **French**      | ~300M        |
| 06 | **Arabic**      | ~300M        |

## Regional

In additional, many regions have languages spoken by far less speakers, but which may have a lot
of geopolitical weight in the area. For example, **Hebrew** in Israel and Palestine, **Polish**
in Eastern Europe, etc. Here is a rough list by region:

- *Europe*
  - *Western*: **Dutch**
  - *Northern*: **Scandinavian** (~Swedish), **Finnish**, **Icelandic**
  - *Central*: **Polish**, **Czech**
  - *Eastern*: **Ukrainian**, **Lithuanian**, **Latvian**, **Estonian**
  - *Southeastern*: **Greek**, **Romanian**, **Hungarian**, **Yugoslavian**, **Bulgarian**
- *Middle East* : **Hebrew**
- *SE Asia*: **Vietnamese**, **Thai**, **Tagalog**
- *Indian subcontinent*: **Bengali**
- *SE Africa*: **Swahili**

## Ancient

Finally, several cultural areas have a traditinal "ancient" language, which is usually no longer
spoken natively by anyone, but carries a great deal of prestige due to history. In the Western
world, these are **Latin** (particularly its Classical form, but Medieval Latin also counts) and
**Ancient Greek** (Attic Greek in particular, but also Epic, Koine and Medieval forms). In China,
it is **Classical Chinese**, and in India, it is **Sanskrit**.

Those four are the main ones, but are others, more miner ones, such as **Coptic** for the Coptic
community in Egypt. To a certain extent, the ancient form of most languages (Early Modern English 
is hardly the same as today's English, be it British or American). *Arabic* is also a special case:
it could technically count as an ancient language, but since it's the lingua franca of the Arab 
world and taught in every Arab country from an early age, I've considered it a modern living 
language, though Standard Arabic is often not the every day language for Arabs.
