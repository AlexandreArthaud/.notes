# Runes

A **rune** is a letter in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets native to the Germanic
peoples. Runes were used to write Germanic languages before they adopted the Latin alphabet, and
for specialized purposes thereafter.

In addition to representing a sound value, runes can be used to represent the concepts after which
they are named (as ideographs). Runes used like this are called *Begriffsrunen* ("concept runes").

The Scandinavians variants are known as *futhark* or *fuþark* (based on their first six letters) and
the Anglo-Saxon variant is *futhorc* or *fuþorc* (due to sound changes in Old English).

## Runic Alphabets

### Elder Futhark

The Elder Futhark was used to write Proto-Norse and consisted of 24 runes. Most probably had a name,
chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself, but they are not directly attested. Philologists
have reconstructed those names based on the names given for the runes in later alphabets.

These 24 runes are often arranged in three groups of eight, each group is referred to as an ætt, 
an Old Norse world meaning "clan" or "group".

The Elder Futhark runes were used from the 2nd to the 8th centuries.

### Younger Futhark

The Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, 
consisting of only 16 characters. They are found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad,
probably in use from the 9th to 11th centuries.

They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes. The
difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the
difference between them was functional (long-branch runes used for documentation on stone, where as
the short-twig runes were used in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).
