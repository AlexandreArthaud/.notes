# Arabic 

The **Arabic alphabet**, or **Arabic habjad**, is the Arabic script. It is written from
right-to-left in a cursive style (meaning that in both printed and written Arabic, letters within a
word are directly joined to adjacent ones), and includes 28 letters.

Most of these letters have contextual letterforms. The Arabic alphabet is considered an abjad, with
only consonants required to be written. However, the optional use of diacritics to notate vowels
make the Arabic script an **impure abjad**. There are no distinct upper and lower case letterforms.

The Arabic script has also been used to write multiple other languages (Persian, Urdu, etc.).

Many letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (iʻjām) above or below
their central part (rasm). For example,  ب , ت , and ث are all different letters.

There are two main collating sequences ("alphabetical orderings") : *ʾabjadīy* and *hijā’ī*:

- *ʾabjadī* is the original and derives from that used by the Phoneician alphabet, thus it is 
  reminescnet of Hebrew and Greek. This ordering was also used for abjad numerals, similar to
  Hebrew gematria or Greek isopsephy.
- the *hijā’ī* (or *alifbāʾī*) order is used when sorting lists of words and names, such as in
  phonebooks, classroom lists, dictionaries, etc. It is based on the graphical similarities of
  the glyphs' shapes
