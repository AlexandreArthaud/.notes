#### Unit 101

- **Vocabulary**: order food, describe people
- **Writing**: Japanese has *three* writing systmes: the hiragna and katana are two syllabaries
  (they describe the same set of syllables, but hiragana is used for native Japanese words while
  katakana is used for loanwords and various other purposes) as well as Chinese characters which
  are kalled *kanji* in a Japanese context. Some consider *romaji*, the most common romanization 
  system for Japanese, widely taught and used in Japan, to be a fourth writing system.
- **Syntax**: Japanese is most often a SOV language (though subject is often omitted as it's also
  a very context dependent language), verbs always come at the end
- **Grammar**: there is no *definiteness* in Japanese (no difference between "a teacher",
  "the teacher", where Japanese would simply state "teacher")

#### Unit 102

- **Vocabulary**: introduce yourself
- **Grammar**: Japanese is a topic prominent language. It explicitly marks the topic, which might
  differ from the grammatical subject of the phrase, with the particle は (normally this kana is
  pronounced "ha" but it becomes "wa" when it's a particle) after the word in question.
- **Respect**: respect is an important topic in Japanese, but for starts it's important to use
  the correct honorific suffix. The most common is さん which roughly translates as either "Mr" or
  "Mrs", however, it's a lot more common in Japanese. It may be used after someone's first name.
  It's the honorific that used between strangers and in other situations, but it's far from the only
  honorific in Japanese.
- **Note on word order**: when saying someone's name and greeting them, usually the greeting comes
  first in English ("hello, John"), but it's the other way around in Japanese.
